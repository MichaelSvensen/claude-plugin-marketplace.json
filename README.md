**TL;DR:** Install this skill to give Claude a structured consulting workflow, useful for case prep, framework practice, or thinking through real business problems. Free, open-source, contributions welcome.

---

## What This Is

This repository contains a consulting knowledge base for [Claude](https://claude.ai), Anthropic's AI assistant. When installed, it gives Claude a structured senior-consultant workflow, built around MBB-style problem-solving and communication patterns built by distilling publicly available MBB frameworks, case prep resources, and consulting methodology into a single knowledge base.

This is not a simple prompt. It is a structured knowledge system with 110+ reference files covering every dimension of consulting work, from MECE issue trees and Pyramid Principle communication to due diligence, post-merger integration, GenAI enterprise strategy, and case interview coaching.

**It is completely free.**

---

## How It Works

Every problem flows through the same consulting operating system — structured, hypothesis-driven, and board-ready at the end.

## For Case Interview and Competition Prep

This skill is built for active practice, not just passive reading.

**For case interview prep:**
- Ask Claude to run you through a case as an interviewer (McKinsey-led, BCG candidate-led, Bain collaborative)
- Get scored on structure, hypothesis, quant, synthesis, and recommendation
- Practice market sizing, profitability, market entry, M&A, pricing across all formats
- Drill behavioral / PEI stories with real-time STAR coaching

**For case competitions:**
- Use Claude to stress-test your team's issue tree before the presentation
- Get a second opinion on your recommendation and the risks you may have missed
- Sanity-check your market sizing assumptions and financial math
- Sharpen your slide action titles and executive narrative

**For self-study and groundwork:**
- Work through the 3 case studies in [CASE-STUDIES.md](./CASE-STUDIES.md) before attempting live cases
- Use [FRAMEWORKS.md](./FRAMEWORKS.md) as your active reference, not just a read-once guide
- Build the habit of structuring every problem MECE before answering

```
"Run me through a McKinsey-style profitability case. Play the interviewer."

"Score my structure on this market entry case on a 1-4 scale across all dimensions."

"My case comp team has 48 hours. Help us stress-test our recommendation."

"Give me 10 market sizing questions and coach me through each one."
```

## The Consulting Mindset

Top consultants operate with a specific cognitive architecture that most people are never explicitly taught:

- They lead with the answer, not the analysis
- They think in structures, not lists
- They form hypotheses before gathering data, not after
- They apply 80/20 thinking ruthlessly
- They communicate in pyramids: governing thought, then evidence

This skill is a scaffold for building those habits. It is not a replacement for judgment, but a way to practice the patterns consistently.
